# Network Neighbourhoods

Algorithm for efficient identification of enclosed cyclic neighbourhoods within
networks, and functions for aggregating neighbourhoods according to network
properties. One example application is automated identification of so-called
"Low-Traffic Neighbourhoods" (LTNs), which can be identified through
a dedicated function, `ltns()`. These are identified by first decomposing
a network into its constituent "neighbourhoods" of enclosed polygons. Traffic
flows along each edge may then be estimated with the [`dodgr_centrality()`
function](https://atfutures.github.io/dodgr/reference/dodgr_centrality.html) of
the [`dodgr` package](https://atfutures.github.io/dodgr), allowing
neighbourhoods to be successively merged across shared low-traffic edges until
a specified stopping criterion, such as total number of neighbourhoods, has
been achieved.
