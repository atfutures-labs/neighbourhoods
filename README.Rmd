# Network Neighbourhoods

Algorithm for efficient identification of enclosed cyclic neighbourhoods within
networks, and functions for aggregating neighbourhoods according to network
properties.

## Low-Traffic Neighbourhoods

One example application of the package is the automated identification of
so-called "Low-Traffic Neighbourhoods" (LTNs), which can be identified through
a dedicated function, `ltns()`. These are identified by first decomposing
a network into its constituent "neighbourhoods" of enclosed polygons. The
`ltns()` function then successively aggregates adjacent neighbourhoods
according to various criteria useful for defining and identifying Low Traffic
Neighbourhoods.
