#' Isolated polygons are groups of one or more polygons which are only connected

#' between these groups. Any groups of polygons with only a single connection
#' are isolated, and are therefore removed from the main `paths` list.
#'
#' This is necessary because isolated polygons only connected by a single path
#' are "attractors" for left-trace algorithms, which converge towards and close
#' around these polygons, preventing tracing of larger polygons which may
#' enclose them.
